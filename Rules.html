                    youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach,
                    team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
                    this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey

                            a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be

                            minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                            assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board
                            whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams
                            from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
                            field may be required to play all their games away.</li>
